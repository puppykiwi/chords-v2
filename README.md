# 🎵 Chords spotify player

The long awaited, by a handful of people, successor to [Chords v1](https://github.com/puppykiwi/chords) is finally here! With modern themes and a more secure 0auth
log-in method.

It's a lightweight, keyboard-centric Spotify client that runs entirely in your terminal. Built with Python, [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/), and the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).
